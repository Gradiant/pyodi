# Welcome to Python Object Detection Insights

A simple tool for explore your object detection dataset. The goal of this library is to provide simple and intuitive visualizations from your dataset and automatically find the best parameters for generating a specific grid of anchors that can fit you data characteristics
## Commands

* [`pyodi paint-annotations`](reference/apps/paint-annotations.md) - Paint COCO format annotations and predictions
* [`pyodi ground-truth`](reference/apps/ground-truth.md) - Explore your dataset ground truth characteristics.
* [`pyodi evaluation`](reference/apps/evaluation.md) - Evaluate the predictions of your model against your ground truth.
* [`pyodi train-config generation`](reference/apps/train-config-generation.md) - Automatically generate a `train_config_file` using `ground_truth_file`.
* [`pyodi train-config evaluation`](reference/apps/train-config-evaluation.md) - Evaluate the fitness between `ground_truth_file` and `train_config_file`..
* [`pyodi coco merge`](reference/apps/coco-merge.md) - Automatically merge COCO annotation files.
* [`pyodi coco split`](reference/apps/coco-split.md) - Creates a new dataset by splitting images into crops and adapting the annotations file
* [`pyodi crops split`](reference/apps/crops-split.md) - Creates a new dataset by splitting images into crops and adapting the annotations file
* [`pyodi crops merge`](reference/apps/crops-split.md) - Translate COCO ground truth or COCO predictions crops split into original image coordinates
